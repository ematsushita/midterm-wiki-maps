## Bugs

[ ] when you hit enter in the search bar, do not lower the hidden form

[ ] The edit point form has weird display

[ ] List map view should show amount of favourites of a list
[ ] Map view no longer allows user to toggle favourite (button works, nothing actually happens)

[ ] When you update a form, the info windows do not reflect new changes

[ ] Title and description of map does not show if user is not logged in

## Enhancements
