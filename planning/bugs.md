## Bugs

[x] When a user loads a list which has no points, the map should still display.

[x] The add point form picture field needs a proper placeholder text

[ ] The add point form lat/lng fields need proper placeholder text

[x] The edit point form does not have a picture url field

[ ] Unfavouriting maps is buggy between "favs" and "my maps"

[x] update ERD to include lat/lng

[ ] when you hit enter in the search bar, do not lower the hidden form

[ ] Map view no longer allows user to toggle favourite (button works, nothing actually happens)

## Enhancements

[ ] The edit point form has weird display

[ ] The edit point button does not hide the form when you click it again

[x] The edit point button should pre-populate with title and description that already exists

[ ] The getPoints function on the map list page should order the query by points.id

[ ] Map should dynamically add points when they are added to the list

[ ] Map should dynamically remove points when they are deleted from the lsit

[ ] Map should pre-populate add-point form with lat/lng when clicked

[ ] List map view should show amount of favourites of a list

[ ] Hover effects for favourite buttons
