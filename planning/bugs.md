## Bugs

[ ] The add point form lat/lng fields need proper placeholder text
[ ] when you hit enter in the search bar, do not lower the hidden form

[ ] Edit point form should slide up if you click it again

[ ] List map view should show amount of favourites of a list
[ ] Map view no longer allows user to toggle favourite (button works, nothing actually happens)
